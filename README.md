## Project Overview
In the "pigGame" project, I've developed an interactive web application that demonstrates my skills in DOM manipulation, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic. The game combines these elements to create a dynamic user experience, with an interface that responds to player actions.

### Key Learnings
- **DOM Manipulation:** Utilized both basic and advanced techniques to add, edit, and update features, impacting both CSS properties and JavaScript functionality.
- **CSS Dynamics:** Implemented dynamic background changes in response to game events like winning, losing, or switching turns.
- **JavaScript Logic:** Focused on understanding the flow of logic, especially in scenarios where users roll dice and the results affect the game's scoreboard.
- **Data Flow:** Gained insights into managing logic and data flow within a web application, supported by a flowchart that outlines the game's logic and event responses.

## Gameplay
"pigGame" offers a fun and engaging experience for one or two players. The objective is to roll dice and accumulate points to reach a score of 100 before the opponent.

### Key Features
- **Turn-Based Play:** If a player rolls a 1, their score resets to 0, and the turn passes to the other player.
- **Strategy Element:** Players must decide whether to 'hold' their current score or risk rolling again for a higher score.
- **Scoreboard:** A basic, yet functional scoreboard tracks the players' points.
- **Reset Functionality:** Includes a reset button for starting new games.

### Player Interaction
Players roll dice and accumulate points, facing the risk of resetting their score if they roll a 1. The game encourages strategic decision-making, as players choose when to hold their score.
